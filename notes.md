I learned that I should read all of the instructions first haha. I was following along before the assignment told me I needed to do different things. But I've used git before, but never consistently enough to just hit the ground running with it. I always look up a brief refresher, but this was already here for me. git pull -> git add FILE -> git commit FILE -m "MESSAGE" -> git push

IP Address for server: 3.210.0.58

Command to ssh: ssh -i [directory to key pair file] ubuntu@3.210.0.58

Now we can reach our website with anigamereviews.com
Use it instead of our IP address!

One thing I learned is I need to study vim way more hahahahah. I probably just need to start editing much of my files in vim to get the hang of it.

Not gonna lie this was a fire hose of information. I don't even know what to do with everything that I learned from just the structure section alone XD Just the fact that I really need to keep track of HTML elements, how to write them, and making sure the code is easy to read. Here's a website we used when we didn't know how to do something: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp

For the input section I could not figure out for the life of me how to get the defualt color for the color picker to be red. Do some more research on that.

Haha find where the cs260 lab is and hop on in there while you're working on this. Or just look up lots of tutorials as we're learning how to deply and include certain elements. Most of all, don't give up! Do a little each day (or every other day as time allows).

### Notes after deliverable:

HTML IS GRUELING! But you can do some pretty cool things with it. While I was looking through the readings and looking stuff up online, the most important thing I found was to just be aware that you can nest tags within each other to create more advanced things.

CSS is next and we'll probably want to get started on it really soon, but it should be fun to make everything look pretty now that we've done it. After finishing up our initial plans though, I think we might want to add one more HTML page as a place to see other people's reviews. We'll add it later if we have time, but keep it up!

We're going into the TA help lab on Friday hahahaha. I'm reading all of these things but I can't really tell what I'm reading at this point. Like I somehow missed a day or something. But just remember that you absolutely want to include flex into your website so that it looks pretty when people want to resize the window. Don't worry if you have to look it up again, but there is power if you choose to include this in your design!
