I learned that I should read all of the instructions first haha. I was following along before the assignment told me I needed to do different things. But I've used git before, but never consistently enough to just hit the ground running with it. I always look up a brief refresher, but this was already here for me. git pull -> git add FILE -> git commit FILE -m "MESSAGE" -> git push

IP Address for server: 3.210.0.58

Command to ssh: ssh -i [directory to key pair file] ubuntu@3.210.0.58

Now we can reach our website with anigamereviews.com
Use it instead of our IP address!

One thing I learned is I need to study vim way more hahahahah. I probably just need to start editing much of my files in vim to get the hang of it.

Not gonna lie this was a fire hose of information. I don't even know what to do with everything that I learned from just the structure section alone XD Just the fact that I really need to keep track of HTML elements, how to write them, and making sure the code is easy to read. Here's a website we used when we didn't know how to do something: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp

For the input section I could not figure out for the life of me how to get the defualt color for the color picker to be red. Do some more research on that.

Haha find where the cs260 lab is and hop on in there while you're working on this. Or just look up lots of tutorials as we're learning how to deply and include certain elements. Most of all, don't give up! Do a little each day (or every other day as time allows).

### Notes after deliverable:

HTML IS GRUELING! But you can do some pretty cool things with it. While I was looking through the readings and looking stuff up online, the most important thing I found was to just be aware that you can nest tags within each other to create more advanced things.

CSS is next and we'll probably want to get started on it really soon, but it should be fun to make everything look pretty now that we've done it. After finishing up our initial plans though, I think we might want to add one more HTML page as a place to see other people's reviews. We'll add it later if we have time, but keep it up!

We're going into the TA help lab on Friday hahahaha. I'm reading all of these things but I can't really tell what I'm reading at this point. Like I somehow missed a day or something. But just remember that you absolutely want to include flex into your website so that it looks pretty when people want to resize the window. Don't worry if you have to look it up again, but there is power if you choose to include this in your design!

Remember to make a separate CSS page for every single one of your HTML pages. Let's finalize what kind of pages we want to have, and if we want to add anymore or remove or just edit the purpose of a page. Remember to use Bootstrap!

A couple of mistakes. This was my first deliverable I waited the last day to do and it wasn't great. Thankfully I finished every other classes work so that I could focus on this deliverable today, but I need to figure out some motivator to have me work a little bit every day on these future deliverables. 

Another thing is that it was super easy to burn out after working on CSS for awhile. It was a lot of fun in the beginning, but eventually I couldn't even think of how I wanted the website to look and that is not a good thing... Anyways. 

Some important things to remember that I learned from CSS. People online know a lot! Don't hesitate to read up on W3 Schools... I think it was called. That one has really basic tutorials to make your site look really pretty. Remember that you need to call a class on any objects you want to modify unless you want to modify every h3, or select, or button tag. But I think that naming classes is safer.

We need to look up when to use main.css and when to use the normal pages css. I felt that most times everything got covered by the main.css, but maybe that shouldn't have been the case. Anyways. You also need to learn how to center align objects like our buttons, not just text. 

I think that's all I have. CSS is hard work because of how much goes into it, but it's also the funnest thing we've done so far. ALSO FIGURE OUT WHY SETTING ALL BACKGROUNDS TO GREY DIDN'T TURN THE MAIN BLOCK PADDING TO GREY.
